# üéµ Next.js Music Player

A sleek and modern music player built using **Next.js** with **App Router** and **Parallel Routing**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This project demonstrates advanced routing capabilities in Next.js along with a fully responsive UI and smooth music playback.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Built with Next.js App Router
- ‚úÖ Parallel Routing for dynamic layouts and smooth UI transitions
- ‚úÖ Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ Responsive design (mobile & desktop support)
- ‚úÖ Component-based architecture

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [Next.js 14+ (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [HTML5 Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement)

## üß≠ Routing Concept

This app uses **parallel routing** to keep the audio player UI persistent across navigation.  
For example:

/music?player=now-playing&content=library



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
